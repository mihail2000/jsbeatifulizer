# JavaScript code beautifulizer

This little utility formats your JavaScript code to satisfy JSLint error checking.
Beautifulizer removes unnecessary spaces, combines 'var' statements and performs indentation according to
JavaScript coding conventions (meaning: JSLint JavaScript conventions)

## Development

Currently, if you introduce objects in var statements, code will be indented incorrectly.
Will be fixed...soon...

## Usage

index.html displays two text areas: one where you're suppose to paste your JavaScript code and another where beautifulized code will be generated.
